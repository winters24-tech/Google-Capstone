## Google Analytics Capstone Project using RStudio "Diamonds" dataset

## This Case Study was completed as part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.

### Objective (Ask Phase)
Analyze the data and find how diamonds can differ to help the marketing team build a digital marketing strategy to find the sweet spot in making diamonds to sell.

### Prepare Phase
The data was downloaded directly from the RStudio "Diamonds" dataset, which comes from the Loose Diamonds Search Engine.


### Process Phase
After regularizing and importing the data, the first step was to inspect each attribute for anomalies. Any data I was uncertain about was marked for exclusion from the final dataset. A full description of the process is described here: [R.Script](https://github.com/winters24-tech/Google-Capstone/blob/main/Diamonds_Capstoneproject_Script.R)

### Analyse Phase
In this phase, queries were created to capture important takeaways that were highlighted in the data visualisations.

### Share Phase
Visualisations were created using RStudio and included in the powerpoint presentation.

### Act Phase
A [powerpoint presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BaoyQzla-NgVSiWzDzHxQQXfB9yCP79E8DybN9JmdLk/edit#slide=id.gc6f980f91_0_0) was compiled with a summary.
